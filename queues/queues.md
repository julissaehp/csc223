## Intro
- A queue is a first in first out data structure
- They can be implemented using arrays or linked lists
- The process of inserting an element in the queue is called enqueue, and the process of deleting an
element from the queue is called dequeue.

## Array representation of queues
- If you want to add an element to the queue, its going to be stored in the rear position.
- If you delete an elemnt from the queue then the value from the front will go down 1.
## Linked Representation of queues
- if the array size cannot be determined in advance, the other alternative, i.e., the linked representation is used
-  In a linked queue, every element has two parts, one that stores the data and another that stores the address of the next element.
- A quee has two basic operations: insert and delete
- To insert first check to see if the front = NULL
## Types of queues
- A queue data structure can be classified into the following types:
	 1.	 Circular Queue	 
     2. Deque	 
     3. Priority Queue	 
     4. Multiple Queue
